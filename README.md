# Overview

The project is called Turmari Desert and it is a C# based game. It creates a grid/map where you fight against mercenaries until defeated.

The purpose of this game is to have a higher kill count or highscore before being defeated by the mercenaries. Since you can't possibly kill them all. you have to use your wit and strategy to defeat the greater amount of enemies.

Tools used in this project:

The C# programming language has a wide library so I didn't use any other library or framework.
